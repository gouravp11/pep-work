                JavaScript is weird sometimes. Arrays don’t throw errors,
                objects behave differently and async stuff is confusing.
                But it’s also fun when things finally click.

            <h2>Why I Started Coding</h2>
            <small>Posted on Jan 15, 2026</small>
            <p>
                I started coding because I liked games and computers.
                At first it was just copying code from YouTube,
                now I try to understand what actually happens.

            <h2>College Life</h2>

            <p>
                College is mostly assignments, deadlines and coffee.
                Sometimes it’s boring, sometimes stressful,
                but you learn more outside class than inside.
